# Belly_button_challenge
Built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

This repository contains the code for the Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard project. Below is an overview of the key files and their locations:

HTML: The main HTML file (index.html) is located on the main branch, not inside any folder.
JavaScript Application: The main JavaScript file (app.js) is located in the /static/js/ directory



Live Site
The live site for the Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard can be accessed at:

Sources
The following lines of code were generated with the assistance of Xpert Learning Assistant:

Line 21 and Line 23 in /static/js/app.js:

Object.entries(result).forEach(([key, value]) => {
    panel.append("h6").text(`${key}: ${value}`);
});
These lines dynamically iterate over an object and append new HTML elements to display key-value pairs in the panel.
